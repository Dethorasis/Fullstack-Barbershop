I'm building a basic barbershop website using React, Typescript, SQLite(Knex), Tailwind CSS and HTML. 
The web app isn't supposed to provide a seamless user experience (one scroll), but help me improve and practice as a full stack developer.

I've opted not to use a form of state management as I feel there isn't enough use of state to warrant it.
